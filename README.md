Reproduction of the results of Bos and Ruban (2000), regarding steady-state solutions of triple-deck equations for supersonic flow over an adiabatic wall.

The numerical scheme is almost identical to that of Cassel et al. (1995), except for the time derivative and the du / dx term in the convective term, which is now taken implicitly.
